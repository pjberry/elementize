 Outputs a name styled like those in the _Breaking Bad_ credits.

 For example, "J. Robins" becomes
                   __
                  |  |
            J. Rob|Bi|ns
                  |__|

 Or, "Davey von Bohlen" becomes
               _
              | |
            Da|V|ey von Bohlen
              |_|

Ultimately, this project is just a way to goof around with Scala's programming concepts.
